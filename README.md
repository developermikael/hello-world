100 Days of Code - Day 2) Learnt how to create new repository on GitHub and the main functions of Git and GitHub

2020 has been a rollercoaster year I could say for mostly every human. The Pandemic of COVID-19 shook this 21st Century time.
I've had the opportunity to stay home, provide for my family, learn information technology from my college, and study code.
Although life has been quite a rollercoaster for me the past 5-6 years... I can easily say that I still and always will feel grateful to be alive.

I know lowkey this is suppoesed to be a serious README.md file about the 100 Days of Code and Hello World, but who can
really write a whole README file about "Hello World!"
